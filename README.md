# CNCToolpathPlanning

This repository contains dataset and python code used for creating a CNN for choosing best CNC toolpath planning strategy. It takes a depth map as input and predicts the best among the three stratgies viz. Iso-scallop, Adaptive, and Hybrid Strategy.

The dataset is generated using the toolpath analysis framework proposed in the paper: Kukreja, Aman, and Sanjay S. Pande, ‘Optimal Toolpath Planning Strategy Prediction Using Machine Learning Technique’, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 123.April (2023), 106464 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106464>
